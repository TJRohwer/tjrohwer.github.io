# **College**
### My CAD work in college has been limited to coursework.
## **Siemens NX**
### Through an engineering design course I was introduced to Siemens NX. The final project for this class had students work in teams to design a bicycle:

### My contributions to the bicycle included:
### 1. The frame.

### 2. The tire and wheel.

### 3. The fender and water bottle holder.

# **High School**
### My highschool CAD experience started with an introductory engineering course, and continued to develop in my county-wide F.I.R.S.T. Robotics Competition (FRC) team.
## **SolidWorks**
### I learned the fundamentals of CAD work in SolidWorks. Here are some example parts:
### 1. Pressure plate

### 2. Rack

## **AutoCAD**
### I applied my SolidWorks experience to AutoCAD.
### 1. Cone

### 2. Goose neck

### 3. Sheet Metal

## **Fusion 360**
### Over covid lockdown I worked on some personal projects. I did not have access to many softwares and turned to Fusion 360 for its ease of access.
### One of those was the design of a toy Biplane for my younger brother that would incorporate a motorized propellor.
### 1. Biplane head & tail

### 3. Bottom wings & top wings

### 5. Propellor

### 6. Piece to hold in the battery and motor

## **Onshape**
### While under covid lockdown restrictions I also joined the FRC team. 
### We fully designed our robot in CAD before building:

### I designed the shooter mechanism:

### The main components for this included:
### 1. The side panels

### 2. The adjustable hood

### 3. The I.R. camera mount
