# **College**
### My CAD work in college has been limited to coursework.
## **Siemens NX**
### Through an engineering design course I was introduced to Siemens NX. The final project for this class had students work in teams to design a bicycle:

### My contributions to the bicycle included:
### 1. The frame.

# **High School**
### My highschool CAD experience started with an introductory engineering course, and continued to develop in my county-wide F.I.R.S.T. Robotics Competition (FRC) team.
## SolidWorks
### I learned the fundamentals of CAD work in SolidWorks. Here are some example parts:
### 1. A pressure plate.
